"Cabin in the Woods" is a study assignment, for the "Virtual environments" course

It is made in Unity engine, and programming is done in C#. It is a scene that can be explored in first person view. The scene consists of a log cabin that has a couch, bed, table, fireplace and several smaller items. Outside the cabin there is a car, outhouse, pier with a boat and also some smaller items. 

In the scene there is also a small adventure game included. The character's objective is to leave the place and get to work as his night shift is about to start. He needs something to keep himself awake first though, and later it is noticed that the car he is supposed to use does not work. It is then up to the player to find the necessary items.

The scene has multiple interactable objects: for example the doors, drawers of the table and the chest on the pier are all animated and can be opened or closed freely by the player. It is possible to light a fire in the fireplace, that also results in smoke coming out of the chimney. All the interactions also have sound effects, and through the whole scene there is an eerie sounding ambient soundtrack playing.

All assets are free-to-use material.

This repository does not contain a complete Unity project, only C# code I have made myself and some screenshots in the screenshots directory.
